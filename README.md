# Natural-Language-Processing
## Overview
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The goal is to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human-like language. NLP combines techniques from linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to bridge the gap between human communication and computer understanding.
